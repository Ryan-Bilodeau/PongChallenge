# PongChallenge
Pong Challenge application as a Unity project

Files I've made can be found in the Assets folder, code I wrote is found in the Assests/Scripts folder (.cs files)
all code I wrote for the project was done in C#

This is a pretty simple game application and was the first application I created.
